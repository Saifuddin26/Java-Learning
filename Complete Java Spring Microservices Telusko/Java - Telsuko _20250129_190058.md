# Java - Telusko
-------------------------------- BASICS OF JAVA ------------------------------
________________________________________________________________________________
.. Application made with java can run on any OS or hardware just JVM must be there.
.. JVM just reads a byte code file
.. Byte code is made when JAVAC compiles our code
.. First file is specified and that must have a main method, which goes first even if 10 files are there
.. JRE java runtime environment, needed to run the code on JVM
.. Libraries are present in JRE
.. JDK = JRE + JVM + LIB
.. Strongly typed, need datatype for variable
.. char example = 'a'
.. possible  ------ short z = 11; int b = 22; double c = 33.33; System.out.println(z + b + c);
.. possible -------- int a = 0b101 -- output is 5 -- because 0b represents binary and converts into decimal
.. possible -------- double b = 12e10; -- output is 1.2E11 -- so many formats are valid in java
.. possible -------- char c = 'a'; c++ -- output is b
.. possible -------- byte b = 127; int a = 256; a = b -- puts byte (smaller box) in int (larger box)
.. impossible -------- byte b = 127; int a = 256; b = a -- not possible without casting
.. casting --------- b = (byte) a; this is explicit casting
.. possible -------- int a = 257; byte k = (byte) a; -- output is 1 because it takes 257 % 256 = 1
.. explicit casting ----- if float is converted to int, it will remove its decimal part
                        float t = 5.6f; int g = (int) t; -- output is 5
.. type promotions ------ byte a = 10; byte b = 30; int result = a * b; -- output is 300, out of range for byte so result will be promoted to int

.. Similar operations: a = a + 1; - a += 1; a++;
.. a++ - post increment; ++a -- preincrement; differs while fetching value
           if a = 7 and a++ answer will be 7 only and then incremented in next print
           if a = 7 and ++a answer will be 8, increment and print
.. short circuit & - && and | - || does not check second condition if first one is not satisfied
.. ternary operator shorthand for if-else
                String status = (age >= 18) ? "adult" : "child";

.. do while : executes at least one time, even if condition is false
.. syntax

    int i = 6; // it's false for while loop but output is Hello 6
    do {
        System.out.println("Hello");
        i++;
    } while (i <= 5);

.. when to use which loop
.. use for loop when iteration and condition are known
.. use while loop when iteration is not known, for example reading characters from files
.. use do while when even if while condition gets false you can print out something for once

------------------------------- OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) --------

.. class is blueprint and the class code is converted into byte code
.. this byte code goes to jvm compiled and here object is created
.. when object is created memory is allocated then only

.. RULES
... In main method there cannot be other method, we make objects and can define variables in main but not methods
... There cannot be more than one public class
... Each public class in separate file with its name as file name
... main method goes into public class
... if a method is private in any class and is called in main it will not be visible
... to make it visible it must be public
... if want to have encapsulation keep it private and call it through get method

... local variable defined in methods are local variables, they exist until that method is in functioning if the method ends local variables are destroyed. Accessible in method only.

... instance variable defined in class outside of methods and are created when object is created, every object has its own instance variables. Accessible in class only

... global variable are defined outside of class and any method but they are not supported here in java, can be done by keyword static
accessible anywhere in code

... arguments passed into the methods are copied to the parameters variables

... Return means what will the method give back it does not mean what method is printing for example
    if addition is done in a method and it prints a sum of two numbers that does not mean method holds that value, method holds what I will make it return

... Concept of memory management was discuss stack vs heap

------------------------------- STACK VS HEAP -------------------------------

In Java, memory is divided into two main parts: Stack and Heap.

### Stack
- The stack is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread.
- It stores primitive data types (int, char, etc.) and references to objects in the heap.
- Each thread has its own stack, which is used to store local variables and function call information.
- Memory allocation and deallocation are automatically managed using the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

**Example:**
```java
public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10; // x is stored in the stack
        int y = 20; // y is stored in the stack
        int result = add(x, y); // result is stored in the stack
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // a and b are stored in the stack
    }
}
```

### Heap
- The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.
- It stores objects and arrays created using the `new` keyword.
- Memory in the heap is managed by the Garbage Collector, which automatically deallocates memory that is no longer referenced.
- Unlike the stack, the heap is shared among all threads.

**Example:**
```java
public class HeapExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person person = new Person("John"); // person object is stored in the heap
        System.out.println(person.getName());
    }
}

class Person {
    private String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name; // name is stored in the heap
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}
```

### Analogy
Think of the stack as a stack of plates in a cafeteria. You can only add or remove the top plate, and the plates are managed in a LIFO order. Each plate represents a method call or a local variable.

The heap, on the other hand, is like a large pool of water where you can allocate and deallocate memory dynamically. Objects float around in the pool, and the Garbage Collector is like a pool cleaner that removes objects that are no longer in use.

In summary:
- **Stack:** Fast access, LIFO order, thread-specific, stores primitive data and references.
- **Heap:** Slower access, dynamic allocation, shared among threads, stores objects and arrays.


_____ ARRAYS______
FIXED SIZE ARRAYS
int [] arr_fixed = new int[5];
// Now I have to assign the numbers one by one like following
int arr_fixed[0] = 10;

// this is incorrect size must be known
int [] array_dynamic = new int [];

// int [] arr_elememts = {10,20,30}
// here size is three and elements are 10,20,30
// int [] arr_elements = new int [] {10,20,30}
// here size is three and elements are 10,20,30

// int [] arr_elements = new int [3] {10,20,30}
// this is incorrect because size is already given in []
// int [] arr_elements = new int [3]; arr_elements = {10,20,30}
// this is incorrect because size is already given in []
// int [] arr_elements = new int[3]; arr_elements[0] = 10;
// this is correct

// int [] arr = new int[3];
// arr[0] = 10;
// arr[1] = 20;
// arr[2] = 30;

// for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
//     System.out.println(arr[i]);
// }

// for (int i : arr) {
//     System.out.println(i);
// }

// int [][] arr = new int[3][3];
// arr[0][0] = 10;
// arr[0][1] = 20;
// arr[0][2] = 30;
// arr[1][0] = 40;
// arr[1][1] = 50;
// arr[1][2] = 60;
// arr[2][0] = 70;
// arr[2][1] = 80;
// arr[2][2] = 90;

// for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
//     for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
//         System.out.println(arr[i][j]);
//     }
// }

// for (int [] i : arr) {
//     for (int j : i) {
//         System.out.println(j);
//     }
// }

--------------------------------- INHERITANCE -------------------------------
.. Parent class is super class and child class is sub class
.. for inheritance there must be a relation between classes
.. child class can have only one parent class
.. multiple inheritance is not supported in java
.. child class can have its own methods and variables
.. child class can use parent class methods and variables
.. child class can override parent class methods
.. parent class cannot access child class methods and variables

________________ ARRAYS _________________
Multidimensional Array:

An array of arrays. For example, a 2D array is an array where each element is itself an array, forming a matrix-like structure.
Jagged Array:

An array of arrays where the inner arrays can have different lengths. This allows for rows of varying sizes.
Dry Run of the Code
Class and Object Creation:

Demo obj = new Demo(); creates an instance of the Demo class.
int num1 = 10; and int num2 = 20; initialize two integer variables.
int result = obj.add(num1, num2); calls the add method of the Demo class, passing num1 and num2 as arguments. The method prints the sum and returns it, which is stored in result.
System.out.println(result); prints the result of the addition.
Single-Dimensional Array:

int arr_[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; initializes an array with four elements.
System.err.println("This is array value at index zero: " + arr_[0]); prints the first element of the array.
Array Initialization and Access:

int arr[] = new int[4]; creates an array of size 4.
arr[0] = 10; assigns the value 10 to the first element.
System.err.println("This is array value at index zero: " + arr[0]); prints the first element.
Static Array Initialization:

int[] arr_static = new int[4]; creates an array of size 4.
The array is initialized with values 1, 2, 3, and 4.
A for loop iterates through the array and prints each element.
Multidimensional Arrays:

int[][] array_mutliStatic = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}}; initializes a 2x2 static array.
int[][] array_mutliDynamic = new int[2][2]; creates a 2x2 dynamic array.
The dynamic array is initialized with values 44, 43, 42, and 41.
A nested for loop iterates through the dynamic array and prints each element.
4D Array:

int[][][][] arr4D = {{{{1, 2}}}}; initializes a 4D array with one element.
System.out.println("This is the 4D array with length one" + " " + arr4D[0][0][0][1]); prints the second element of the innermost array.
Jagged Array:

int[][] arrjagged = {{1, 2}, {1, 3, 100}}; initializes a jagged array with two rows of different lengths.
System.out.println("This is the jagged array " + arrjagged[0][0] + " " + " " + arrjagged[1][2]); prints elements from the jagged array.
Dry Run of the Nested Loop for array_mutliDynamic
Initialization:

int[][] array_mutliDynamic = new int[2][2];
array_mutliDynamic[0][0] = 44;
array_mutliDynamic[0][1] = 43;
array_mutliDynamic[1][0] = 41;
array_mutliDynamic[1][1] = 42;
Loop Execution:

i = 0, j = 0: Prints 44
i = 0, j = 1: Prints 43
i = 0, j = 2: Exits inner loop
i = 1, j = 0: Prints 41
i = 1, j = 1: Prints 42
i = 1, j = 2: Exits inner loop
i = 2: Exits outer loop


Drawbacks of arrays
... Continuous and fixed size can cause problem if the data size is not known
