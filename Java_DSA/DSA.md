Sahil Agrawal:
Right way to do DSA
Understand the concept clearly first
Try to code yourself 30 mins if not watch the video and do it yourself
Do atleast two contest round weekly.

Sahil and Sarra
Break big problems into small problems
Do not build things from scratch look for solution first
adapt with technology
